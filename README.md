- Past ratings
- User similarity
- Movie similarity

---

## 🧰 Tools & Packages

- Creating a **realRatingMatrix** object  
- Building models:
  - Popularity-based
  - User-based Collaborative Filtering
  - Item-based Collaborative Filtering
- Evaluating recommendations (accuracy, precision, recall)  
- Visualizing similarity and results
